        <h2>History of Angkor Wat</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Angkor Wat was built during the height of the Khmer Empire and was dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, reflecting the king's devotion. The construction took several decades to complete and involved thousands of artisans, laborers, and engineers. After the fall of the Khmer Empire, Angkor Wat became a Buddhist site, which it remains today. The temple is now a UNESCO World Heritage site and continues to be an important pilgrimage destination for Buddhists worldwide.</p>
