            <p>Angkor Wat is the largest religious monument in the world, located in Siem Reap, Cambodia. It was originally built as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu during the 12th century by King Suryavarman II of the Khmer Empire. The temple complex is known for its grandeur, intricate carvings, and stunning architectural design. Over time, Angkor Wat was transformed into a Buddhist temple, which it remains today, and it stands as a symbol of Cambodia's rich cultural heritage.</p>
            
            <p>Spanning over 162 hectares (402 acres), Angkor Wat is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, drawing millions of visitors each year. The temple is renowned for its magnificent layout, which reflects the cosmic structure of the universe. The central towers represent the peaks of Mount Meru, the center of the universe in Hindu mythology, while the surrounding moat symbolizes the cosmic ocean.</p>

            <p>Angkor Wat is also famous for its detailed bas-reliefs that decorate the temple's walls, depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, including the famous Churning of the Ocean of Milk. The temple's breathtaking sunrise and sunset views, along with its historical and spiritual significance, make it a must-see destination for travelers and cultural enthusiasts alike.</p>
